The robot’s weapon is hidden in a nanostructure and is exposed only in the tumour microenvironment, sparing healthy cells. The study is published in the journal Nature Nanotechnology. The research group at Karolinska Institutet has previously developed structures that can organise so-called death receptors on the surface of cells, leading to cell death. The structures exhibit six peptides (amino acid chains) assembled in a hexagonal pattern.\n",
        "“This hexagonal nanopattern of peptides becomes a lethal weapon,” explains Professor Björn Högberg at the Department of Medical Biochemistry and Biophysics, Karolinska Institutet, who led the study. “If you were to administer it as a drug, it would indiscriminately start killing cells in the body, which would not be good. To get around this problem, we have hidden the weapon inside a nanostructure built from DNA.”\n",
        "Created a ‘kill switch’\n",
        "The art of building nanoscale structures using DNA as a building material is called DNA origami and is something Björn Högberg’s research team has been working on for many years. Now they have used the technique to create a ‘kill switch’ that is activated under the right conditions.\n",

        "“We have managed to hide the weapon in such a way that it can only be exposed in the environment found in and around a solid tumour,” he says. “This means that we have created a type of nanorobot that can specifically target and kill cancer cells.”\n",
        "\n",
        "The key is the low pH, or acidic microenvironment that usually surrounds cancer cells, which activates the nanorobot’s weapon. In cell analyses in test tubes, the researchers were able to show that the peptide weapon is hidden inside the nanostructure at a normal pH of 7.4, but that it has a drastic cell-killing effect when the pH drops to 6.5.\n",

            "* **Type of Technology:** The researchers utilized **DNA origami nanorobots** to target cancer cells.  This is a distinct approach from genetically modified viruses, targeted chemotherapy, or immunotherapy agents.\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Targeting Mechanism:** The nanorobots primarily rely on the **acidic tumor microenvironment** for targeting.  They don't primarily use antibodies, magnetic fields, or radioactive isotopes.\n",
            "\n",
            "* **\"Kill Switch\" Activation:** The nanorobots' \"kill switch\" is activated by the **acidic pH** (approximately 6.5) of the tumor microenvironment.  This differs from activation by sunlight, interaction with healthy cells, or high oxygen concentrations.\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Cell Death Induction:** The **peptides** within the nanorobot are responsible for inducing cell death in cancer cells.  The DNA origami structure itself, surface proteins, or nanoparticles are not directly responsible for this function.\n",
