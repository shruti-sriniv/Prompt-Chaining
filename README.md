Prompt-Chaining with the Gemini API
This project explores a powerful method for interacting with large language models: prompt-chaining.

The repository's main purpose is to show how to link multiple prompts together to solve more complex problems that a single prompt cannot. By taking the response from an initial call to the Gemini API and using it as a variable for the next prompt, we can build multi-step logical flows, generate long-form content, or guide the model toward a specific outcome.
